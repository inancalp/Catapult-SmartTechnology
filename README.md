# Catapult
An experimental catapult project programmed with Arduino.

## Introduction
This project involves building a catapult with Arduino that offers both manual and automated throwing modes. It uses servo motors, an ultrasonic sensor, a remote control, and an LCD screen to provide an interactive experience.

## List of Components
- Servo Motors: Used for creating tension and rotation.
- Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects objects for automated throws.
- Remote Control: Allows users to switch between manual and automated modes.
- LCD Screen: Displays the current mode of the device.

## Functionality
- **Object Detection**: The ultrasonic sensor detects objects within a certain range, triggering automated throws when movement is detected.
- **Servo Motors**: Two servo motors provide tension and rotation for the catapult.
- **Remote Control**: Change the functionality of the device with the remote control.
  - *Manual Throw*: Use the remote control for manual throws.
  - *Automated Throw*: The ultrasonic sensor controls automated throws.
- **LCD Screen**: Shows the current mode of the device.

## Usage
- To switch to manual throw mode, use the Remote Control.
- Enable automated throws by relying on the Ultrasonic Sensor's object detection.
- Check the LCD Screen to see the current mode.
